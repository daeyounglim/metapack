Description: Contains functions performing Bayesian inference for meta-analytic and network meta-analytic models through Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Currently, the package implements Yao, Kim, Chen, Ibrahim, Shah, and Jianxin Lin (2015) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1006065> and network meta-regression models using heavy-tailed multivariate random effects with covariate-dependent variances. For maximal computational efficiency, the Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers for each model, written in C++, are fine-tuned. This software has been developed under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health and Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.
