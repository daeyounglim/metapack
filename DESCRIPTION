Description: Contains functions performing Bayesian inference for meta-analytic and network meta-analytic models through Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Currently, the package includes multivariate meta-regression models with a partially observed within-study sample covariance matrix and network meta-regression models using heavy-tailed multivariate random effects with covariate-dependent variances. For maximal computational efficiency, the individual Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for every model is fine-tuned, written in C++.
